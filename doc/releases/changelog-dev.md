# Release 0.33.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* The `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods of `Operator` and `MeasurementProcess` no longer rely on the
  object's address is memory. Using `==` with operators and measurement processes will now behave the
  same as `qml.equal`, and objects of the same type with the same data and hyperparameters will have
  the same hash.
  [(#4536)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4536)

  In the following scenario, the second and third code blocks show the previous and current behaviour
  of operator and measurement process equality, determined by the `__eq__` dunder method:

  ```python
  op1 = qml.PauliX(0)
  op2 = qml.PauliX(0)
  op3 = op1
  ```
  Old behaviour:
  ```pycon
  >>> op1 == op2
  False
  >>> op1 == op3
  True
  ```
  New behaviour:
  ```pycon
  >>> op1 == op2
  True
  >>> op1 == op3
  True
  ```

  The `__hash__` dunder method defines the hash of an object, which is important for data
  structures like sets and dictionaries to work correctly. The default hash of an object
  is determined by the objects memory address. However, the hash for different objects should
  be the same if they have the same properties. Consider the scenario below. The second and third
  code blocks show the previous and current behaviour.

  ```python
  op1 = qml.PauliX(0)
  op2 = qml.PauliX(0)
  ```
  Old behaviour:
  ```pycon
  >>> print({op1, op2})
  {PauliX(wires=[0]), PauliX(wires=[0])}
  ```
  New behaviour:
  ```pycon
  >>> print({op1, op2})
  {PauliX(wires=[0])}
  ```

* The old return type and associated functions ``qml.enable_return`` and ``qml.disable_return`` are removed.
 [(#4503)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4503)

* The ``mode`` keyword argument in ``QNode`` is removed. Please use ``grad_on_execution`` instead.
 [(#4503)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4503)

* The CV observables ``qml.X`` and ``qml.P`` are removed. Please use ``qml.QuadX`` and ``qml.QuadP`` instead.
  [#4533](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4533)

* The method ``tape.unwrap()`` and corresponding ``UnwrapTape`` and ``Unwrap`` classes are removed.
  Instead of ``tape.unwrap()``, use :func:`~.transforms.convert_to_numpy_parameters`.
