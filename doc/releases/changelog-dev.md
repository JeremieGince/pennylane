# Release 0.33.0-dev (development release)

<h3>New features since last release</h3>

<h3>Improvements 🛠</h3>

<h3>Breaking changes 💔</h3>

* The `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods of `Operator` and `MeasurementProcess` no longer rely on the
  object's address is memory. Using `==` with operators and measurement processes will now behave the
  same as `qml.equal`, and objects of the same type with the same data and hyperparameters will have
  the same hash.
  [(#4536)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4536)

* The old return type and associated functions ``qml.enable_return`` and ``qml.disable_return`` are removed.
 [(#4503)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/pull/4503)

* The ``mode`` keyword argument in ``QNode`` is removed. Please use ``grad_on_execution`` instead.
